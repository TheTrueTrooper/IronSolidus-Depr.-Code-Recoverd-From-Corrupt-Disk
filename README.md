# IronSolidus-Depr.-Code-Recoverd-From-Corrupt-Disk
Broken on new Eng. Did a neat thing or two so keeping it from refference.

The Corrupton of the hard drive lead to a new vers. of the UDK Eng.. This led to a need to rewrite code to meet the new macro and language requirements. The Code was salvaged as it has some things i may want to revisit.

Most of the code was writen in C++.

For the new code and working copy check the private repo 'IronSolidus-Source-2016' titled "A 2016 Eng. Rebuild for UDK 4.13.2 C++/C#" 

Noteable things: 
-Templated menu system: that built on to the huds system. This System allowed for bindings of actions to functions to buttons that respec. the higher arch. Also allowed for easy icon style drawing with just a registration and a points to custom draw around the button. (IE sprites above or bellow.)

-Templated menu system binder:The controllers side for registry of this.

-Parts : A build on to the socket system to allow for plugging them together in a more puzzle like system. Was not done.

-Simple Pawn System: a pawn that moved like a tank. Not done(need work to make use of the socket system).

-A Mecha Builder Pawn System: a system that was needed to test things and would allow the player to build the pawn. Not done.

-Also some testing code...
